title: "A graph-regularized non-negative matrix factorization method to discover organizational units of chromosomes"
event: Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB)

location: Chicago, United States
summary: ""
abstract: "Three dimensional organization of the genome is emerging as an important determinant of cell-type specific expression and is implicated in many diseases, including cancer. Hi-C is a type of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay used to study three-dimensional organization of the genome. Analysis of Hi-C data has shown that the genome is organized into higher-order organizational units such as compartments and topologically associated domains (TADs). We present a non-negative matrix factorization approach, commonly used for clustering and dimensionality reduction, to infer clusters of regions from Hi-C data. To preserve the spatial dependency of Hi-C data (i.e. closer regions interact more with each other), we impose regularization on NMF with the nearest-neighbor graph of each genomic loci. Our results show that NMF and graph-regularized NMF are both important to discover clusters that exhibit a significant association with the presence of CTCF binding at the cluster boundaries and are robust to simulated sparsity and lower sequence depth."
