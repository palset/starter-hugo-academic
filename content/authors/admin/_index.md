Hey! I'm Palash, as a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida, I am currently researching the application of machine learning in protein design. I have previous experience working as a part of the Machine Learning Research Team at Reliance Jio, India, where I collaborated with domain experts from various fields such as life sciences and molecular modeling to solve data science problems. My interests include optimization techniques, visualization, design, Gaussian processes, and bioinformatics.
